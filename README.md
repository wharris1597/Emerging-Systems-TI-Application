# Emerging-Systems-TI-Application

The two artifacts I chose to submit are the Milestone 2 State machine diagram and the term project. These two artifacts encompass what I learned here in this course and I am very proud of what I was able to accomplish. In Milestone 2, I programmed two GPIO pins and a UART in order to read and write from a serial console in order to control on-board LEDs. In the project, I utilized these peripherals in addition to a temperature sensor and a timer in order to build a prototype for a thermostat. I am most proud of my solution-finding skills because I had many problems arise but I persevered and ultimately was successful in delivering the project. I used Code Composer Studio for this project becuase the Lab guide used this software and that made it easier to troubleshoot and build my code. In the future, I will read more into documentation in order to know exactly all the functions of the board and its peripherals.
